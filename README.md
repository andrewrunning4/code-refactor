# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Goal

```
AS A developer for a client
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards 
SO THAT client site is optimized for SEO
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Result

```
The resulting codebase follows acceptance criteria to the best 
of my abilities. I believe the codebase is organized the best I 
know how. All of the code works and loads. The links work how they 
should be expected to work. The repository was created properly and 
followed proper naming conventions.
